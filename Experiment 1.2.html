        Dear <u>Ramesh</u>,
    </p>

    <p>
        How have you been? I hope you are doing good. What about your family? I hope they are also doing great! Well, I’m writing this
        letter to ask you why you are not coming to college for the last four days?
    </p>

    <p>
        Is everything stable? What’s the matter? You are not in college for the last 4 days. I hope you don't have any illness. The class teacher 
        was asking about you. As you know there was practical yesterday and you missed that too.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, the teacher has told us that he will explain that practical once more. He has scheduled it for Monday. I hope till then you will 
        come. And if you are not well then please inform me about your health. I’m waiting for your reply.
    </p>

    <p>
        Kind Regard's
    </p>

        Yours Faithfully, <br>
        Azad Khan
